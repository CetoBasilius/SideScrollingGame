A 2d multiplayer game including an in-built level editor.

It can currently be run as an applet or as a java application, currently the program itself works to travel around the map using A,S,D,W keys.

The game itself is in its final stages, although it is being rebuilt with an improved programming layout and architecture.

Below is a version of the almost finished game. the editor can be activated by typing the " = " character. debug information can be displayed by typing the asterisk character. Sounds currently freeze the applet when played because of the way sound is handled. The world in which you can move is not finished and is a test playground.

note, that the source code is not for the game in the applet. the game is being rebuilt in a better design.
